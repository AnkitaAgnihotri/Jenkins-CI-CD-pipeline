# Jenkins-CI-CD-pipeline (in DevOps Fashion)
## Continous Integration and Continous Deployment Project
## For this project I worked on following and gain working experience : -
### 1] Java as Programming language and Linux as OS and did all tool installation through terminal and tool configuration (setting path, permissions, running environment, dependencies, pom.xml enhancement etc).
### 2] selenium and web driver geckodriver for Integration testing
### 3] maven as build tool for generating artifacts (war/jar file) using maven goals clean,compile,test,install,verify,deploy,package
### 4] scm(Source code management) used as github and also worked on Gitea for local repositories.
### 5] Jenkins used as CI/CD tool for manual buil, build trigger using (periodic, poll scm, webhook trigger), using Jenkins groovy file, deploy artifact on jfrog using post build steps and code quality inspection using post/pre steps and deployment on web server using Tomcat post build step plugin(web server)
### scm (git/gitea repo), build with invoking Ansible playbook(YAML file) and post build actions to notify through E-mail
### 6] Jfrog_Artifactory used to store binaries (war/jar) file in structured manner as binarySourceCodeRepo
### 7] Sonarqube used for code quality Inspection and code coverage for testing
### 8] Apache tomcat server for deployment and Application UI visualization
### 9] Ansible playbook for installing and deploying tools and services from one machine to another or same using SSH connection set in inventory file for performing automation with platform independent (only requirement python2/3)
### 10] Docker/kubernetes for Apllication contanerization and orchestration for enabling automation
